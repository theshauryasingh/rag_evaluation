Basic RAG Evaluation with Cosine Similarity
===========================================

This project demonstrates a simple evaluation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model. The script retrieves relevant documents based on a query, generates a summary, and evaluates the generated summary using relevance scoring (cosine similarity).

Types of RAG Evaluation Metrics
-------------------------------

Evaluating RAG models can involve various metrics, depending on the task type and objective. Here's an overview:

1.  **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**:

    -   Typically used in machine translation.
    -   Measures overlap between generated and reference text at the n-gram level.
    -   Effective for assessing content similarity but may not align well with RAG tasks where wording diversity is high.
2.  **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**:

    -   Commonly used for summarization tasks.
    -   Measures n-gram and longest common subsequence overlap.
    -   Good for evaluating content capture, especially in text summarization.
3.  **Precision/Recall Metrics**:

    -   Useful for binary relevance tasks, where specific terms or phrases need to be detected in generated content.
    -   Suitable for retrieval tasks but limited for assessing nuanced responses in generative tasks.
4.  **Relevance Scoring (Cosine Similarity)**:

    -   Measures semantic similarity between query and response embeddings.
    -   Ideal for assessing relevance in RAG systems, where the generated text should semantically align with the query.
    -   Used here for its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing semantic context in RAG tasks.
5.  **Human Evaluation**:

    -   Involves direct assessment by human evaluators for fluency, coherence, and relevance.
    -   While reliable, human evaluation is time-consuming and may introduce bias. It's often used as a benchmark.

Chosen Evaluation Type: Cosine Similarity
-----------------------------------------

For this task, we use **cosine similarity** to measure relevance. This metric is well-suited for RAG systems as it captures the semantic closeness of the generated response to the input query without relying on exact text matching. Cosine similarity offers a quantitative assessment of content relevance, essential for verifying if generated responses align with the user's query intent.
